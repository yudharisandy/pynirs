# pynirs
python-nirs is the code to create ML model of NIRS signal. There are 4 models, random forest, gradient boosting, neural network and partial least square.
this code is part of my thesis pre-research.

The code use as less as possible preprocessing technique because of the long term objective is to use in the real-time condition (rapid prediction).

You can open the code using notebook such as google colab, visual studio code or others.

Thank you.
